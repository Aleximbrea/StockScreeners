# Stock screeners
Filter stocks that are part of the s&p500 index

## Get started

## How it works
1) When you open the app it checks to see if you have market data downloaded as binary with HDF5
    - If you do it checks if it is recent
    - If you don't it downloads it

### Dependencies
- Using **yfinance** library to get stock data
- Importing s&p500 stocks from **wikipedia**
